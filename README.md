# Car-Sales-Project
This project is designed to analyze car sales and profits for each dealer in 2 parts:

Part 1: Create Visualizations using Excel
Part 2: Create dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics

The dataset used in this project comes from the IBM Accelerator Catalog

Tasks done in Excel:
TASK 1: Develop a bar chart to capture Quantity Sold by Dealer ID sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold
TASK 2: Develop a line chart to capture Profit by Date and Model
TASK 3: Develop a column chart to capture Profit by Year and Dealer ID
TASK 4: Develop a line chart to capture Sum of Profits for Hudson model cars by Dealer ID

Tasks done in IBM Cognos Analytics
TASK 1: Create a dashboard/report page titled as Sales to capture the following KPI metrics:
-Capture Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars)
-Capture Quantity sold
-Create a bar chart to capture Quantity sold by model
-Capture Average quantity sold
TASK 2: Develop a column chart to display Profit by Dealer ID in the Sales dashboard/report page sorted in ascending order.
TASK 3: Create another dashboard/report page titled as Service and capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
-Create a column chart to capture the number of recalls per model of car
-Create a treemap to capture the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews.
-Create a line and column chart to capture the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit.
-Create a heatmap (in Cognos) / Pivot table with heatmap (in Looker) to capture the number of recalls by model and affected system

As part of the project, charts were created in Excel using Power Query and pivot tables, and a dashboard was subsequently developed in IBM Cognos Analytics.
